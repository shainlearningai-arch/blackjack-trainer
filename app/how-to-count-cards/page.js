          <p className="text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Card counting is a skill, not a trick. It gives you a mathematical edge by tracking
            whether the remaining shoe is favorable to you or to the dealer. This guide covers
            the Hi-Lo system, the same method used in this trainer.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-white font-bold text-xl">Why counting works</h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            A blackjack shoe is not random between hands. Cards dealt in previous hands are gone
            until the shoe is reshuffled. If many low cards (2 through 6) have already been dealt,
            the remaining shoe is full of high cards. That is good for you: high cards produce
            more blackjacks, and blackjack pays 3:2. High cards also bust the dealer more often,
            because the dealer is forced to hit on totals of 16 or less.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Conversely, a shoe full of low cards hurts you. The dealer is less likely to bust,
            and you are less likely to be dealt a blackjack.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Card counting tracks this imbalance. When the count says the shoe is rich in high
            cards, you raise your bet. When it says the shoe is low-card heavy, you bet the
            minimum.
          </p>

        <section className="space-y-4">
          <h2 className="text-white font-bold text-xl">The Hi-Lo values</h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Every card in the deck is assigned a point value. You add or subtract that value
            from your running count every time a card is dealt, face-up, to any player or
            the dealer.
          </p>

            The reason the values are balanced (equal numbers of +1 and -1 cards) is that a
            fresh shoe starts at exactly 0. After any complete shoe is dealt, the count returns
            to 0. This means you can detect imbalance simply by watching whether the count
            drifts positive or negative.

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            The running count is a single number you keep in your head. You start at 0 at the
            beginning of a new shoe and adjust it by the Hi-Lo value of every card you see.
            You count every visible card: your cards, other players' cards, and the dealer's
            face-up card. The only card you cannot count is the dealer's hole card, since it
            is face-down.

            The running count alone is incomplete. A running count of +8 sounds very positive,
            but if there are 4 decks remaining in the shoe, those extra high cards are spread
            thin. If there is only 1 deck remaining, +8 is extremely concentrated and very
            meaningful. The true count corrects for this by dividing the running count by
            the number of decks remaining.

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Card counting does not let you predict individual cards. Even at a true count of +8,
            you will still lose many hands. The edge from counting is small, around 0.5 to 1
            percent over the long run. This means you need a large number of hands before the
            math works in your favor consistently.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Counting also does not help if your basic strategy is wrong. Every basic strategy
            mistake costs more than the counting edge gives back. Master basic strategy first.
            Once your decisions are automatic, add the count.
